# HCL2JSON

This tool implements only the `-reverse` option of [`json2hcl`](https://github.com/kvz/json2hcl) and provides binaries for all major platforms.
With the help of [`go-npm`](https://github.com/sanathkr/go-npm) it can be installed via `npm install -g hcl2json` or used as a dependency in other nodejs project.

The main goal is to convert `HCL` to `JSON`.
